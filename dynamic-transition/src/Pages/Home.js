                <p>The first "sneaker" originated from the Plimsoll shoe, introduced by the Liverpool Rubber Company. These rubber-soled shoes had a canvas upper and were primarily used for sports and leisure. They were called "plimsolls" because of the horizontal line on the sole, which resembled the Plimsoll line on a shipâ€™s hull.</p>
