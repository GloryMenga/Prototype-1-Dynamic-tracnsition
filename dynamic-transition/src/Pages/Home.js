                <p>The first "sneaker" originated from the Plimsoll shoe, introduced by the Liverpool Rubber Company. These rubber-soled shoes had a canvas upper and were primarily used for sports and leisure. They were called "plimsolls" because of the horizontal line on the sole, which resembled the Plimsoll line on a shipâ€™s hull.</p>

                <p>The first basketball shoe, the Converse All-Star, was introduced in 1917. It became widely popular in the 1920s when Chuck Taylor, a basketball player, endorsed it. This shoe marked the beginning of sneakers as both functional and fashionable footwear.</p>

                <p>In Germany, Adolf "Adi" Dassler founded the company that would become Adidas. His goal was to create high-performance athletic shoes, and in 1928, athletes wore Dassler shoes in the Olympics. The brand later became globally recognized for its innovative designs.</p>
